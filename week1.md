# Week 1

## Day 1

*Question of the day:* How would you tell a computer to find the square root of a number?

### Goals

* Zen of Python
* Variables
* Loops
* `input()`
* `int()`
* `float()`
* `str()`
* `print()`
* `type()`
* `pow()`
* `help()`

### How to learn

* Retrieval practice: quiz yourself
* Spaced, interleaved practice: do not work on the same problem for 5 hours. Take a break, take a walk, practice something else.
* Attempt to solve problems before being shown the solution: tackle things head-on, even if you don't know the answer
* Reflection: review what you've learned periodically and ask yourself questions

#### How this affects class

* We will always start with a problem you don't yet know how to solve.
* I may have simultaneous homework so you can alternate.
* You _will_ be at the whiteboard, which is scary, but necessary.
* Frequent quizzing.

### Setup sandbox

* `mkdir -p ~/ironyard/sandbox`
* `cd ~/ironyard/sandbox`
* `pyenv virtualenv 3.4.2 sandbox`
* `pyenv local sandbox`
* `pip install "ipython[all]"`
* `ipython notebook`

### Learn about IPython Notebook

* Make sure to show keyboard shortcuts

### Exercise

Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
