# Week 3

## Day 1

*Question of the day:* How would you find the odds of rolling 21 or higher on 6 dice using a computer?

### Goals

* Stochastic programming
* Randomness

### Exercise

Compute the value of pi only using randomness.

Imagine you have a 1 meter by 1 meter square. This square has a circle inscribed in it so that the diameter of the circle is 1 meter.

If you generate random points in the square, you should be able to tell if the points are inside or outside the circle.

### Assignment

[Random art](random-art)

## Day 2

*Question of the day:* Given the following lifespans, taken from a much larger population, what percentage of people would you expect to live to be older than 99?

Data: [52, 61, 67, 75, 79, 92, 94, 97, 100, 100]

### Goals

* Plotting
* Simple statistics
* Basic statistical inquiry

### Exercise

Take these weights of domestic house cats:

```py
weights = [11.3, 8.06, 9.96, 9.76, 10.09, 9.93, 9.76, 11.47, 8.09, 11.38, 8.47, 9.44, 10.52, 8.02, 9.46, 8.44, 8.95, 9.26, 10.62, 8.76]
```

Plot a histogram of these weights. Find the mean and standard deviation of this sample of cat weights.
